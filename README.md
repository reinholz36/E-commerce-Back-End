# E-commerce-Back-End

## Overview: 

I connected the back end for an e-commerce site that can be run through the terminal. I took a working Express.js API and configure it to use Sequelize to interact with a MySQL database. A user of the application can now view, add, edit, and delete categories, products and tags.

## Technologies used:
  * SQL 
  * JavaScript
  * Node.js
  * Sequelize
  * Dotenv
